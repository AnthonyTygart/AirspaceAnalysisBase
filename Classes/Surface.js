//have function GetSurfaceBondaryAtStation
//use initial width and slope of flare to determine surfaceboundary
//store boundary as line with additional paramaters (start sta, end sta) which will allow for determining if point is contained in boundary
//remebmer surfaces are symetrical so you only need to check if it is between ALI and boundary 
//this check will be to determine if offset is < distance to bondary at same station
